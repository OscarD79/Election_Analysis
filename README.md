# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

### At the request of the Colorado Board of Elections I have preformed an audit of a recent congressional election. In order to complete this audit I have had to complete the following tasks:

1. Calculate the total number of votes.
2. Get a full list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the information above.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.68.1

## Summary
Based on the analysis of the data provided by the Colorado Board of Elections the results were as follows:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
- There were three candidates who received votes:
	- Diana DeGette
	- Charles Casper Stockham
	- Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
	- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 total votes.
	- Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 total votes.
	- Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 total votes.
- The winner of the election was:
	- Diana DeGette, who received 73.8T of the votes and 272,892 total votes.

## Challenge Overview

### The challenge was intended to add to the completed code the county break down of the election results. Using the code we had already completed to calculate the vote totals and percentages by candidate, we are able to refactor the code to focus on vote totals and percentages by county. We are also able to adjust the print statements and write functions to the text file to use the new variables set up for the counties.

## Challenge Summary 

### The challenge was intended to add to the completed code the county break down of the election results. With this in mind, we break down the percent of the county out of the total vote and the total votes for the county itself. We also add a note of the county with the largest turnout (which is of course, Denver).
